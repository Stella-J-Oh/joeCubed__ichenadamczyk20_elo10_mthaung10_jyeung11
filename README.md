## Description
A website to contain lists about topics, meant to serve as creative inspiration. This website will be useful for creating in-depth universes about things you donâ€™t know that well, like how Zootopia is all about animals, or Steven Universe is all about gemstones. Users can log in to save certain items on lists as well

Implemented using Flask, Python 3, SQLite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Foundation, and various RESTful APIs.
